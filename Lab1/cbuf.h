//TODO:
//  Maybe add an element to the struct for 
//  size - 1, since I use it so often.
//  Don't know if saving a single subtraction is worth the
//  extra memory

//TODO:
//  Perhaps make these all functions instead of defines.
//  That would make it much easier to read...

//note that size **MUST** be a power of 2
//if it isn't you will get strange (broken) behavior
//This works becuase  x & ( n - 1) is the same as
//  x mod n, if n is a power of 2

//concept shamelessly taken from 
//http://www.ganssle.com/tem/tem110.pdf
//the code from which was released to the public domain

//To use a cbuf, create a struct and buffer in your code, 
//  and then call the CBUF_INIT function.  As an example
//
//#define BUF_SIZE (1<<6)
//uint8_t buf[BUF_SIZE]
//cbuf_t circular_buffer;
//CBUF_INIT(&circular_buffer, &buf, BUF_SIZE); //(1<<6) = 2^7 = 128
//
//TODO: make the caller allocate memory, so there is no malloc?
//   This would allow for easier determination of available/used
//   memory at compile time.
